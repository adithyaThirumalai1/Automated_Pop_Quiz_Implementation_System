# Automated Pop Quiz Implementation System.

The project comprises of 2 android apps, Teacher app and Student app.

The teacher app is primarily developed to allow the teacher to create quizzes and track the progress of every student over time. The app offers a variety of quiz formats to choose from, like, Multiple choice questions (MCQ), Single blankers, double blankers, True or False, etc. It also provides detailed statistics in the form of charts and reports about every test taker. The entire data is stored on the cloud and uses NoSql database. It also provides a complete login and account system for every registered teacher.

The student app asks for a unique code to access the desired test. This code is generated in the teacher app which then is shared to the students at the desired time. The app employs various security measures in order to restrict plagiarism/Malpractices.
